## Hello world

Big tip of the hat to Charlie Park and Karl Broman (especially [https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/overview.html](https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/overview.html))


The files are on the gh-pages branch

I hope that my colleagues and students using windows can also use this.

To develop pages locally you need to be able to run 

```
jekyll serve
```

Which is easy on linux. Perhaps if you are on windows it is possible after you install windows sub linux (WSL) 

```
wsl --install
```

and I tested Ubuntu 22.04
